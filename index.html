<p><i>What is Bad Life Simulator?</i></p>
<p>Bad Life Simulator is an <b>open-source, web-based, text-based life simulator</b> inspired by BitLife and The Sims.</p><br>
<p><i>Why Bad Life Simulator?</i></p>
<p>Bad Life Simulator is community focused and community driven. This means <b>no paywalls or microtransactions, <i>ever</i></b>, and the community gets the features the community wants.</p><br>
<p><i>Where can I play it?</i></p>
<p>The game hasn't been released yet, but it's not too far away all things considered. If you want to stay in the loop and be one of <b>the first to get access</b>, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/DPGZ26BKTA" target="_blank">discord server</a>.</p><br>
<p><i>I want to contribute. How can I do that?</i></p>
<p>I'm currently recruiting volunteer <b>writers, designers, and programmers</b> who want to help out with development. Remember, you won't get paid, as this is an open-source project. If you want to help out, or just throw around a couple of ideas, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/DPGZ26BKTA" target="_blank">discord server.</a></p><br>
<p>Thank you so much for your interest in Bad Life Simulator. I hope you enjoy it when it comes out :)<br>- Mildly Concerning, <i>Developer</i></p>
